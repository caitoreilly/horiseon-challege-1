## Description

---

The starter code of this web application required restructuring to ensure accessibility. I adjusted the header and footer so that they were no longer <divs> with classes. I then added in sections for the different parts of the web page. Then I consolidated classes for the information and images for the main content sections of the web page. I also fixed an issue with an id for the "Search Engine Optimization" link in the header.
